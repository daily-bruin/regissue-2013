        <span class="caption">I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Shields up! Rrrrred alert!</span>
        <p>They were just sucked into space. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Besides, you look good in a dress. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. We have a saboteur aboard. Computer, belay that order. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Talk about going nowhere fast. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canape s? Are you up for promotion? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?
        <p><span class="aside right emphasis">This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise.</span>What's a knock-out like you doing in a <a href="http://example.com">computer-generated gin joint</a> like this? I'll be sure to note that in my log. Computer, lights up! Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. You enjoyed that. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I am your worst nightmare!
        <p>Sorry, Data. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I'll alert the crew. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Your head is not an artifact! Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Not if I weaken first.
        <p>Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? This should be interesting. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. <span class="aside left emphasis">We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone</span>Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?
